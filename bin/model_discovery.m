  %{
   PURPOSE:
   The purpose of this function is to take a matrix of integrated library
   terms "A" and find as many models as possible.

   INPUT:
   A         - a matrix of integrated library terms
   threshold - see documentation of svd_regression
   alignment - determines how close two values are. alignment âˆˆ [0,1].
   error     - determines how close a value is to zero:
        Suppose we have two models:
            model_1: "1.0000 0 0 0 0   "
            model_2: "1.0000 0 0 0 0.01"
        if you think the last elements of model_1 and model_2 are too
        close, and thus model_1 and model_2 should be the same model, you
        just set "error" larger than "0.01" (last element of model_2). Then
        the regression should average model_1 and model_2:
            model_new: "1.0000 0 0 0 0.005"


   OUTPUT:
   G_new - appends "A" and "c_ave" so that we can run regression on "G_new"
           to see if we could find more new models.
   c_ave - a matrix of average coefficients.
