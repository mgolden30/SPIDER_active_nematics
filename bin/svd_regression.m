function [c, residual, residual_sequence] = svd_regression( A, threshold )
  %{
  PURPOSE:
  This function takes a matrix of integrated library terms and finds the
  best sparse model. Here by "model" I mean a vector c such that c
  is sparse (physically interpretable) and norm(A*c)â‰ˆ0 in some sense.

  INPUT:
  A         - a skinny matrix of integrated library terms
  threshold - a sparsification parameter in [0,1]. A model will be
              sparsified if 

  OUTPUT:
  c         - the identified sparse coefficient vector
  residual  - a dimensionless measure of the accuracy of the sparse model
              Formally it is the ratio of the residual to the largest term
              in the model.
              
              residual = eta = || Ac || / max(vecnorm(c.*A))
  
  residual_sequence - a typical example is [0.3566, 0.3611, 0.4934, 1]
                      this sequence shows how the residual changes with
                      sparsification. 0.3566 is the residual of the dense
                      c, and it increases as we set terms to 0.
